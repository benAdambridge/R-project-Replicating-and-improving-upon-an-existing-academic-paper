Replication of an existing academic paper

Using RMarkdown, I replicated the cleaning, manipulation and presentation of variables, of an existing academic paper, in the hopes of producing the same results. 

I found, using advanced data analysis techniques such as Regressions and Diagnostics, some flaws in this exisisting paper in the inclusion of variables (many missing values) and omission of key independent variables such as demographics. 

Additionally, the project demonstrates an ability to write reports out of R using RMarkdown, and demonstrates an ability to clean and manipulate data correctly, in order to produce comprhensive written output.
